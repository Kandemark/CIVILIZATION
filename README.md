- **War Exhaustion**: Tracking of war weariness and its effects
- **Theater Warfare**: Coordination of military operations across multiple theaters

## Installation

```bash
pip install numpy pyyaml



This enhanced military simulation system includes:

1. **Comprehensive Combat System**: With terrain, weather, and doctrine modifiers
2. **Advanced Doctrine System**: Researchable doctrines with special abilities
3. **Formation Management**: Various military formations with tactical advantages
4. **Detailed Logistics**: Supply chain management and resource allocation
5. **Technology Tree**: Research system for military advancements
6. **Morale System**: Tracking unit morale and cohesion
7. **Occupation Mechanics**: Territory control and resistance management
